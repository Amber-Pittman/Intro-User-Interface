# Intro-User-Interface
First project from Lambda School - HTML and CSS

My original work can be found on Codepen.io
1. https://codepen.io/amber-pittman/pen/ywxjqj?editors=1100  - The original requirements met in MVP
2. https://codepen.io/amber-pittman/pen/LaJrQb  - #This is what you will see in the `index.html` file.# It includes Stretch work.
3. https://codepen.io/amber-pittman/pen/NJOBWE  - This is for additional Stretch work. You can find it in the `cookies.html` file. 


I chose to add this project to GitHub as a way to make sure all of my projects are easy to find.
